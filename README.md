# download_webpic
A simple crawler which can download files of the given type(default jpg) in the given website page

Maybe useful and convenient to be add into a larger and stronger crawler code:)

It can run alone to download the files as well.

For now, there're only two methods to find files in a web page. Probably working on adding more reliable methods.
